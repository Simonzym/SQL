knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(RMySQL)
con2 <- dbConnect(MySQL(),
                 user = 'trial',
                 password = 'password',
                 host = '127.0.0.1',
                 dbname='titanic')

titanic <- read.table("/home/php2560/titanic.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

dbWriteTable(con2, "titanic_yzhang", titanic, overwrite = T)


```


###1. Group rows by pclass and survived, for each group, calculate the average age
```{r}
query <- "select pclass, survived, avg(age) as avg_age from titanic_yzhang
group by pclass, survived;"
dbGetQuery(con2, query)

```
###2.Select the rows where survived equals to 1 and group the rows by pclass, then calculate the average age of each group
```{r}
query <- "select pclass, survived, avg(age) as avg_age from titanic_yzhang
   where survived=1
   group by pclass, survived;"
dbGetQuery(con2, query)


```

###3.Select rows name, pclass, survived and age where the name begins with "(a)sen(bb)". [a and b refer to any single character and they can be the same.]
```{r}
query <- "select name, pclass, survived, age from titanic_zhang
where name regexp '^.sen.+';"
dbGetQuery(con2, query)

```

###4.Select name, pclass survived and age rows where the name contains "Jakob"
```{r}
query <-"select name, pclass, survived, age from titanic_yzhang
where name regexp 'Jakob.*$'";
dbGetQuery(con2, query)
```
###5.Select name, pclass survived and age where the name contains "ivar"
```{r}
query = "select name, pclass, survived, age from titanic_yzhang
   where name regexp 'Ivar.*$'";
dbGetQuery(con2, query)
```
###6.select name, pclass, survived and age where the name contains "Ivar" and a comma has appeared before "ivar"(not nessarily next to each other)
```{r}
query = "select name, pclass, survived, age from titanic_zhang
   where name regexp ',.*Ivar.*$'";
dbGetQuery(con2, query)
```
###7.group by pclass and calculate the average fare of each group.
```{r}
myQuery <- "select pclass, avg(fare) as avg_fare from titanic_yzhang
          group by pclass;"
myData <- dbGetQuery(con2, myQuery)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(myData, aes(pclass, avg_fare)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
```
###Challenge
```{r}
C_query = "select pclass, sex, age, fare, survived, parch from titanic_yzhang where survived = 0;"
C_data = dbGetQuery(con2, C_query)
```
###Plot
```{r}
P_query = "select pclass, sex, avg(survived) as avg_survival from titanic_yzhang 
           group by pclass, sex;"
P_data = dbGetQuery(con2, P_query)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
ggplot(P_data, aes(as.character(pclass), avg_survival, group = sex, color = sex))+
  geom_line()+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format())+
  labs(x = "Class", y = "Average Survival")
```
